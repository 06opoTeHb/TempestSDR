\chapter{Practical attack} 

Before explaining how the software works internally, let's present a demonstration of a practical video eavesdropping attack. Its main aim is to show the ease with which such an attack could happen. In the meantime this will give an opportunity to explain the characteristics of the received signal and how they are exploited.

As in the real world, we will start with no knowledge of the victim's system. We will estimate the frequency at which the emission strength has the best Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We will then analyse the signal to detect the resolution and refresh rate of the screen. We will afterwards lock onto the signal and try to recover the original video. We will also discuss some techniques that could be utilized to improve the quality of the image.

\section{The Setup}

The choice for a SDR front-end for this demonstration is a USRP B200\footnote{Refer to \ref{sec:hw} Hardware for discussion on currently available SDR devices.}. Depending on the particular requirements, an attacker might prefer mobility over accuracy and choose the smaller FlexiTV\texttrademark MSi3101 SDR USB Dongle. However, for this demonstration we will attempt to obtain the highest possible resolution. Therefore we need an SDR radio that is capable of obtaining a wide bandwidth. This makes the 32 MHz of Bandwidth that the USRP provides a much better choice than the 8 MHz available from the Mirics dongle.
