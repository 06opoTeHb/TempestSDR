TempestSDR
=============

This project is in its infancy and is not operational! Please come back in Q2 of 2014 for more information about what it is and how to use :)

Folder Structure
------------

The different folders contain the different subprojects. The TempestSDR folder contains the main C library. The project aims to be crossplatform with plugin support for SDR frontends in different folders.

Compiling
------------

The project is built with Eclipse with the CDT plugin. Currently it supports Windows and Linux. Some frontend plugins might not be crossplatform.

### Windows

You need to have MinGW installed and gcc and make commands need to be in your path. Also javac and javah also need to be in your path.

### Linux

To be announced soon.
