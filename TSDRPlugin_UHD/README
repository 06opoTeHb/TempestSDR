UHD_INCLUDE needs to point at the UHD header include directory (the one with folder "uhd")
BOOST_INCLUDE needs to point at the  boost header include direcotory (the one with folder "boost")

For Linux:

This requires boost libraries and UHD to be installed

For Windows:

Everything is built with Visual studio because of the fact that boost do not support MinGW properly. Sad.

Compile boost (this forces usage of Visual Studio 2012 since there are some bugs with 2013):

    Download sources
    Extract them in a folder, in my case C:\boost_1_55_0
    cd to that folder
    bootstrap.bat --toolset=vc11
    b2 architecture=x86 link=static toolset=msvc-11.0 stage
	b2 architecture=x86 link=static toolset=msvc-11.0 install
	
This will install in C:\Boost, I moved mine to D:\Boost32, then for For X64

	b2 architecture=x86 link=static toolset=msvc-11.0 address-model=64 stage
	b2 architecture=x86 link=static toolset=msvc-11.0 address-model=64 install

Which I moved to D:\Boost64	
	
The way to compile for X86 is:

	Make sure you have Python/Cheetah/etc all of the prerequisites for UHD (look it up online)
	download libusb from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbx/files/releases/1.0.18/binaries/ and extract into C:/libusb
	make folder uhd/host/build
	get into that folder
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" -DLIBUSB_LIBRARIES:STRING=C:/libusb/MS32/static/libusb-1.0.lib -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIRS:STRING=C:/libusb/include/libusbx-1.0 -DBOOST_ROOT:STRING=D:/Boost32 ../
	Compile with Visual Studio
	
For X64 should be
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" -DLIBUSB_LIBRARIES:STRING=C:/libusb/MS64/static/libusb-1.0.lib -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIRS:STRING=C:/libusb/include/libusbx-1.0 -DBOOST_ROOT:STRING=D:/Boost64 ../
